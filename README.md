If you see the whole copy pasted code in one of the commits, that is because I messed up but didn't know how to restore the previous file so I went and copied the code 
from my github to replace my messed up code.

If you check the previous versions before that one, you'll see that it's pretty much the same code and I was working on it for a few hours. 
You probably won't find another code as messed up as mine so you'll know for sure that it is my code,
especailly since if you check the older commits you can see me slowly getting to the final code.
